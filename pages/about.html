                      When you starting a company you are thinking on how to cut
                      expenses. One of such options to cut the startup costs is
                      a company logo design. But is it good idea to order a
                      cheap logo or work without company logo at all?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Logo represents company’s identity. First impression is
                      made by logo or its absence. To know the importance of a
                      logo just answer one question: “How many big, leading and
                      famous companies don’t have logos?” If you company doesn’t
                      have a logo this can raise doubts and negative thoughts.
                      If logo was made by non-professional designer or made by
                      owner of the company it is sometimes worse than no logo at
                      all.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      One of the popular questions is – why my logo should be
                      custom? If logo is created with the use of a clipart
                      (premade graphic elements from the public collections) it
                      may look like or be identical to other logos and even your
                      competitors’ logos. This will make identification of your
                      company difficult or your logo may be easily mixed up with
                      logo of another company. This situation may harm your
                      reputation and money invested in marketing of your brand
                      will be wasted. Good company logo reflects the main point
                      of your company, its values and helps in successful
                      development of the business. Also, it is important to
                      distinguish the logo design for big companies and
                      start-ups. Logo for the big company may consist only of a
                      one graphic element (Nike swoosh) and it will be easily
                      identifiable but for small company such logo is a bad idea
                      because you will need to spent huge amounts of money to
                      promote it.
